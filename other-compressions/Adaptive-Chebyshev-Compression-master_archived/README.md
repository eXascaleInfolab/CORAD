## Time-series compression using Chebyshev polynomials

This is still WIP repo that tries to implement the following article:
{Ukil, Arijit, Soma Bandyopadhyay, and Arpan Pal. "IoT data compression: Sensor-agnostic approach." 2015 Data Compression Conference. IEEE, 2015.}

You can see 'Chebyshev compression.ipynb' under notebooks to see current results.

# TODO:
* testing of importance score function
* Documentation
* Licensing

Feel free to validate my work on the noted article and to open issues:)
