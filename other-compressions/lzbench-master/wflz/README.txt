wfLZ is a compression library designed for use in game engines.  It is
extremely cross platform and fast enough to use anywhere I've run into.

The previous stable version is hosted at google code:
https://code.google.com/p/wflz/

The current github version is less tested and has not yet been in shipped
products.
