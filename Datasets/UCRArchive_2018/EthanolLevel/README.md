# EthanolLevel dataset

This dataset is part of the project with Scotch Whisky Research Institute into detecting forged spirits in a non-intrusive manner. One way of detecting forgery without sampling the wine is through inspecting ethanol level by spectrograph. 

The dataset covers 20 different bottle types and four levels of alcohol: 35%, 38%, 40% and 45%. Each series is a spectrograph of 1751 observations. 

This dataset is an example of when it is wrong to merge and resample, because the train/test split are constructed so that the same bottle type is never in both train and test sets. 

There are 4 classes. 

- Class 1: E35
- Class 2: E38
- Class 3: E40
- Class 4: E45

Train size: 504

Test size: 500

Missing value: No

Number of classses: 4

Time series length: 1751
